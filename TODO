* DONE Decide on a game idea

  The theme is 'A Small World'.

  1. Platformer that takes place in one small level
  2. Virtual terrarium game
     
     Maybe this could be a bit like a tamagotchi game.
  
  3. Terraforming or planet-building game
  4. Shooter on a small planet
     
     Projectiles can travel around the planet with circular motion.
     
  5. Microscope style adventure game
     
     You can shrink down to explore different levels.
     
  6. Mario galaxy style platformer
  7. Being hunted on a small planet or world
  8. Roguelike that happens on a small, ever-changing world
  9. Space sim where you can explore small planets
  10. Point and click adventure game in small world

  No. 2 (Terrarium) looks like the winner. Plus it sounds like a
  pretty relaxing idea overall.
